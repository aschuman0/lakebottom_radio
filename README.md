Lake Bottom Radio is an internet radio station which broadcasts a few shows weekly from its home near the Bitterroot Mountains of Montana. 
The Web App for Lake Bottom Radio is a Django application. It uses Google Cloud SQL as a datastore and is hosted on the Google Cloud Platform. The frontend is done with Bootstrap 3.
In the summer of 2019, the site was refactored from being hosted on a Linux VM with a local mySQL database to use of Google Cloud Platform services.
